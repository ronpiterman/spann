= About Spann =

Spann is a Java Library for the Spring Framework which adds generic api for annotation support to the spring container.

It relates to spring's annotation support the same way the "XML Schema Extension" (introduced in Spring 2.5) relates to spring's XML configuration: it allows developers to hook into the bean definition creation phase. 

Spann introduces *meta programming* via annotations (or any other class meatdata) to the spring framework.

== Whats wrong with spring's built in annotation support ? ==

Spring built in annotation support has a very static nature: in spring 2.5, four annotations are predefined for different types of beans ( @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Conroller ).

For Spring 3.0, further annotations were introduced, but these remain of static nature: Annotation classes (and how spring interprets them) are defined by the container. Defining new Annotations with new functionality remains an assignment for Container developers and requires deep knowledge of the Container internals.

== Spann's annotation support ==

Spann allows application developers to easily hook into the bean definition creation phase of the container via annotations.

It provides an API to allow custom beans creation and manipulation via any class metadata in general, and annotations metadata specifically.

There are many usecases for such functionality. To name a few:

 *  Custom proxy creating as implementation for an interface (Auto creation of DAO implementation methods).
 *  Implementing "strategies" by wrapping a bean's Method by a strategy implementation object and configuring it via annotations.
 *  Using templates of beans to wrap around a single method; for example for Message (or JMS) listener methods.

== Technical overview ==

Spann consists of 2 core modules (or maven projects):

=== org.spann:spann-metadata ==

The metadata module provides a complete Metadata scanning facility. It uses asm visitors
to extract metadata from selected classes.

Main features of spann-meatdata are:

 *  API to refelect all java metadata of the target classes (with exception of code instructions) without loading *any* of the scanned classes. 
 *  Rule based scanning: API to optimize the scan by defining which metadata artifacts are read and which remain ignored.
 *  Lazy loading of all unloaded metadata on demand. For example: metadata of super classes, methods etc is transparently lazy-loaded on demand.
 *  Rule based lazy loading: API to define how much metadata is lazy loaded on demand. For example: when lazy-loading methods of a class, load also method-annotations.


=== org.spann:spann-spring ==

The core module introduces class path scanning and configurable Class-Metadata-Visitor API for the spring container.

Main features of spann-spring:

 *  API to define custom visitors for class metadata. This allows developers to  process of annotations or any other class metadata.
 *  Additional API for custom handling of class and/or method annotations.
 *  A few generic annotations for common tasks, to allow developers further access to
spring features (For example to implement abstract methods by delegation)
