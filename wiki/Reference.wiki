= About Spann =

Spann is a small Java Library for the Spring Framework which adds annotation support to the spring container, beyond the build in annotation processing. 

It brings the same power to annotations as the XML Schema Extention, introduced in spring 2.5, brings to the xml configuration.

== Spring's build in annotation support ==

Spring built in annotation support is of a static nature: four annotations are predefined for different types of beans ( @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Conroller ).

For Spring 3.0, further annotation support was announced, but also this remains static in nature: Annotation classes and their functionality are defined by the container. Defining new Annotations with new functionality remains an assignment for Container developers and requires deep knowledge of the Container internals.

== Spann's annotation support ==

Spann is created to change this and allow application developers to easily define annotations and their functionality inside the spring container.

There are many usecases for the need of such a functionality. To name a few:

 *  Custom proxy creating as implementation for an interface (Auto creation of DAO implementation methods).
 *  Implementing "strategies" by wrapping a bean's Method by a strategy implementation object and configuring it via annotations.
